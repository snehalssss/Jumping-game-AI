# Jumping-game-
I have created a simple interface using tkinter and basic python. also have used basic algorithm of path finding and collision detection.


In the "Jumping Game" project:

    Overview: This project simulates a basic AI-powered game where a player (or AI entity) jumps over obstacles.
    Interface: Created using Tkinter for simplicity and user interaction.
    Algorithms:
        Pathfinding: Implements a basic pathfinding algorithm to guide the AI in choosing the optimal path.
        Collision Detection: Detects and responds to collisions with obstacles, ensuring realistic gameplay dynamics.

This project demonstrates foundational knowledge of game development principles, GUI design, and algorithmic problem-solving in Python.
